Dataset was downloaded from synthea - https://synthea.mitre.org/

Synthea is an open source program that was developed by the MITRE corporation. It is programmed to randomly generate patient data.
In other words, it is a simulation modeled after the data that a hospital might generate into an electronic medical record system.
The data that gets generated includes: patient demopgraphics, encounters, drugs administered, lab values, equipment and supplies, providers, claims data, among other things.

What is most impressive about Synthea is the way that the data is simulated. Many aspects of Synthea are modeled after real life epedemiological trends and patterns.
